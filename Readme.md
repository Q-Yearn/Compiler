# Compiler

## Description

> This project is a compiler design that generates RISCV code from C language using Koopa IR.

> The project files include input C source files, the specific syntax tree output, Koopa IR, and RISCV code output, all of which start with "hello."

> The "src" folder contains the source project files for the compiler.

## Environment 

>  Docker Working Environment Configuration and Reference Documentation, see [this](https://pku-minic.github.io/online-doc/#/preface/).

> The Makefile file is generic and can still be used to compile the source code after making the necessary modifications and organizing it as required.

## Test

> Test cases have already been configured in Docker. For more details, please refer to [this](https://github.com/pku-minic/compiler-dev-test-cases).
